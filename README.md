# MongoDB $in operator with empty array returns no results

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in MongoDB queries involving the `$in` operator with an empty array.  The expected behavior is that a query like `db.collection.find({ field: { $in: [] } })` should return all documents, since an empty array implies that the field can match anything. However, MongoDB interprets this as no match, returning an empty result set.

This is a potential source of unexpected behavior in applications, particularly when dynamic query parameters are used.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file demonstrates the problematic code.  Run it with a MongoDB instance to reproduce the error.

The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution and workaround for the problem.

## Solution

The recommended approach is to use alternative logic to handle empty arrays in `$in` queries. Instead of directly passing an empty array, check the array length before executing the query, allowing for a conditional query if the array is empty.
